    <h1>Oral health diagnostics</h1>
    <h2>What it takes to keep your teeth always healthy and your smile always bright?
    </h2>
    <p>
        That’s right, a regular assessment of dental caries lesions, plaque, calculus, and staining!
        <br><br>
        That is why we recommend all our customers a regular, quarterly visit to our dentists. Such a checkup will ensure that any problem will be spotted on time and there will be an option to easily get it fixed. Also, oral health diagnostics is a built-in part of all our appointments. Especially when there’s any next procedure to follow.
