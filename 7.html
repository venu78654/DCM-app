          It may take care of purely aesthetic concerns of the patient (teeth whitening, straightening; etcâ€¦). Also, it may involve fixing teeth that were mechanically damaged or chipped off.
          <br><br>
          Sometimes it involves Dental Filling and Bonding, which are quite simple dental procedures. Usually, they do not require numbing or any kind of anesthesia applied.
          <br><br>
          Just with the help of bonding and adhering materials, the damaged tooth area can be easily visually fixed.
          <br><br>        
          The same goes for other aesthetic and generally cosmetic dental procedures which we offer.
